IceCube.ipynb : notebook for icecube competition on kaggle implementing graph convolutional neural network model described in "Graph Neural Networks for Low-Energy Event Classification & Reconstruction in IceCube" 
icecube_graphnet.ipynb : does the same are the above generally and uses the GraphNet library
